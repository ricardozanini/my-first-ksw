# Getting Started with Kogito Serverless Workflow

This guide quickly explains how to getting started with Kogito Serverless Workflows in your local machine

## Prereqs

1. [Java SDK installed](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
2. [Maven installed](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
3. [Quarkus CLI](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling)

To edit your workflows:

1. Visual Studio Code with [Red Hat Java Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) installed
2. [Serverless Workflow Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-extension-serverless-workflow-editor)

## Creating the project

To create the project skeleton, run:

```shell
quarkus create app \
  -x=kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow \
  -x=quarkus-container-image-jib \
  -x=quarkus-resteasy-jackson \
  -x=quarkus-smallrye-openapi \
  -x=kubernetes \
 org.acme:my-first-ksw:1.0
```

The `org.acme:my-first-ksw:1.0` is the group id, artifact id, and version of your project.

This command will create a Maven Quarkus project in the `my-first-ksw` directory with all required Kogito dependencies.

Next, to make sure everything is working fine, try to compile the project with:

```shell
quarkus build
```

## Creating your first Workflow

Go to the directory `src/main/resources` and create a file named `greetings.sw.yaml`. 
You can play around and type the workflow definition by hand using the editor intellisense feature or copy and paste from the snnipet below:

```yaml
---
id: greetings
version: '1.0'
name: Hello Person
start: InjectHello
functions:
- name: printOutput
  type: custom
  operation: sysout
states:
- name: InjectHello
  type: inject
  data:
    message: 'Hello '
  transition: PrintMessage
- name: PrintMessage
  type: operation
  actions:
  - name: print
    functionRef:
      refName: printOutput
      arguments:
        message: "${ .message + .name }"
  stateDataFilter:
    output: "${ { message: (.message + .name) } }"
  end: true
```

Then run `quarkus dev` from the project's root to start the Quarkus console.

To interact with the application, we have a couple of options described in the sections below.

### Using the Swagger UI

Point your browser to the http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/ address. 
You should see a POST endpoint definition for this workflow named `Greetings`. Click on the POST entry and in the button "Try it".

Copy and paste the following content:

```json
{
  "workflowdata": {
   "name" : "John"
  }
}
```

Click on "Execute" and you should see a response similarly to this one:

```json
{
  "id": "c758eb9d-6242-4bda-a5f5-7f5d302943c0",
  "workflowdata": {
    "greeting": "Hello John",
  }
}
```

### Calling the service via command line

You can use an one line `curl`:

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{"workflowdata" : {"name": "John"}}' http://localhost:8080/greetings
```

### Building your project's image

You can use the Quarkus CLI to build your image with the following command:

```shell
quarkus build \
  -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \
  -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=knative \
  -Dquarkus.container-image.group=dev.local
```

After building the image, you can start the container running:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p8080:8080 dev.local/my-first-ksw:1.0
```

You can then interact with the application the same way you did before in the previous sections.

### Deploying to Knative

Assuming you have [installed Knative locally](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/) on your Minikube, run:

```shell
# Configure your docker env to push the images to the minikube registry first
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env --profile knative)

# rebuild the application to genereate the image in the right place
quarkus build \
  -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \
  -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=knative \
  -Dquarkus.container-image.group=dev.local

# Install the app!
kubectl apply -f target/kubernetes/knative.yml

# You should see something like "service.serving.knative.dev/my-first-ksw created" in the terminal
```

Wait a couple of seconds and run `kn service list`:

```shell
kn service list

NAME           URL                                              LATEST               AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
my-first-ksw   http://my-first-ksw.default.127.0.0.1.sslip.io   my-first-ksw-00001   12s   3 OK / 3     True  
```

Access the application as you normally would.

> Tip: Run `minikube tunnel -p knative` to be able to access the application from your terminal. Your admin password might be asked.
